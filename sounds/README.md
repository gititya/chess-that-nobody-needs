# Sound Files

Place the following sound files in this directory for audio effects:

- `move.wav` - Sound when a piece moves
- `capture.wav` - Sound when a piece is captured
- `check.wav` - Sound when a player is in check
- `game_end.wav` - Sound when the game ends

The game will work without these files, but audio effects will be disabled.
